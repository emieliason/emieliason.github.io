        <h2>In Summary</h2>
        <p>My name is Emi Eliason! My pronouns are <strong>she/her</strong>. I am a <strong>senior Computer Science major</strong> in my last semester at Amherst College, although I often joke that I'm a <strong>studio art</strong> major in spirit as well. I love taking walks, drawing, cooking and baking, hanging out with friends, and playing copious amounts of Minesweeper. When I'm not doing my classes, you may see me post on behalf of Amherst's school newspaper, <em>The Amherst Student</em>, as the head of their social media team. I also have been a TA for several years for the Computer Science department, and I'm passionate about making computer science accessible, especially to women and people of color who may feel intimidated by the field. :)</p>

        <h2>My Life in 5 Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>I was born in New Jersey to two newlywed art history graduate students. I was an exceptionally chubby baby - 104th percentile for weight! - and my mom would get offended if strangers didn't comment on how cute I was. My father found a job in St. Paul, Minnesota as an art history professor, and that's where we've been ever since I was two years old.</li>
            <li>I had a pretty average childhood. I went through all of the typical girly phases - My Little Pony, princesses, horses, etc. My mom would throw extravagant birthday parties for me. I talked way before I could walk, and would often complain about having to walk.</li>
            <li>As an elementary school kid, I loved Pokemon and other kids' cartoons! It were these things that sparked my love for drawing, and I would draw my own knockoff Pokemon cards so I could play with them against my dad. I also loved writing, and filled up an entire notebook with my original story about a dog and cat making it out in the wild together. My elementary and junior high were joint, so I grew up with a relatively stable group of friends all the way through.</li>
            <li>In high school, I became more reserved and introverted. I found social outlets with people who shared my interests online. I took debate for two years before realizing that I hated conflict more than anything. I took AP and IB classes and invested a lot of my time in school.</li>
            <li>College was a great fresh start for me, as I gained confidence and made friends who weren't just due to proximity but also due to shared interests and similar personalities. I considered being a French major for a while, but ultimately fell in love with computer science, and continued to take English and art classes on the side. Post-graduation, I hope to find a career that balances my aesthetic sensibilities with my coding skills, like a front-end web developer, animator, or video game artist. Hopefully this class will be a great step in the right direction!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>My favorite kind of music is K-Pop! My favorite artists are <strong>Victon</strong>, <strong>Monsta X</strong>, <strong>Loona</strong>, <strong>WJSN</strong>, and <strong>GWSN</strong>. I also like the Japanese artist <strong>Reol</strong> and electro swing!</li>
            <li>I'm hyperflexible and can bend down to being almost completely flat from a sitting position.</li>
            <li>I sleep a <em>lot</em>. I can regularly go 12 hours before waking up, and I take naps almost every day.</li>
            <li>My favorite foods are garlic bread, ice cream sandwiches, and anything teriyaki.</li>
            <li>I still can't drive! I didn't practice enough to take the driver's exam, and ever since I've been at college, I haven't had enough time at home to practice.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It's great to meet you!</p>
