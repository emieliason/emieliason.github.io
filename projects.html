        <h2>Amherst Student Linktree</h2>

        <img id="project" src="project1.png" alt="A basic website with clickable links leading to Amherst Student articles.">
        <p>One of the perennial problems with Instagram is that there is no way to include a hyperlink in a regular post. This made it harder for the Amherst Student to promote their articles as we had to essentially instruct the readers to go to the website themselves. When I was a wee computer science major, armed only with online tutorials, I attempted to create a webpage that would easily link articles from the Student's social media page to the official website. This is a project I intend to revisit using the knowledge and skills gained from this class!</p>
